Chaat
    Description:
        Tartare fans, this might be your favorite new Ethiopian dish. 
        Kitfo is ground raw beef that’s been mixed with kibbe, the 
        spiced clarified butter. It can be accompanied by mitmita,
        another popular Ethiopian spice blend. The result melts 
        in your mouth and tastes great with the typical accompaniments 
        of gomen (cooked greens) and a soft fresh cheese.

Butter chicken (or murgh makhani)
    Description:
        On my Addis Eats walking tour, we sampled doro wat, a rich red-colored
        chicken stew Richman describes as “iconic.” We were lucky to eat it in
        a restaurant, since the dish is usually “hard to find, because it’s 
        generally made in people’s homes,” she explains. Good doro wat should
        be prepared with Ethiopian chickens raised free-range on small farms,
        rather than the larger “farangi” (foreigner) chickens you can also 
        find in the country. The stew gets its deep red hue from berbere, 
        and the richness is often offset with an accompaniment 
        of fresh cheese and gomen (stewed greens).
