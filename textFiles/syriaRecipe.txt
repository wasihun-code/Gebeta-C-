Syrian Shawarma
    Description:
        Shawarma is one of the most famous street foods in the Middle East. 
        The roots of this delicious dish go back to the Levant and the Ottoman Empire,
        when, in 1906, Sadeeq Khabaz left his restaurant job in Bursa and traveled to
        Damascus to open a shawarma restaurant. Khabaz adapted the recipe, introducing
        the distinct taste of the Syrian shawarma.
        
        Shawarma consists of chicken breast and special spices. The meat is placed on
        a metal skewer and rotates on a vertical grill. As the meat cooks, thin slices
        are cut from the skewer with a very long, sword-like knife. The chicken slices
        are then placed on home-made bread, along with pickled cucumber and a special garlic cream.

    Recipe:
        1.  Melt the niter kibbeh in a Dutch oven over medium heat, 
            then add the onions, ginger, cumin, pepper, garlic and berbere spice.
        2.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently,
            for about 30 minutes, or until onions are golden brown.
        3.  Towards the end of cooking, the onions should sizzle slightly,
            so if necessary, increase the heat.
        4.  Transfer half of the onions to a blender, puree them, and pour them
            back into the pot with the rest. Salt and mix well.

Yabrak
    Description:
        The Syrian yabrak plate goes back to Ottoman times. The name yabrak is Turkish,
        meaning leaves of the vine. Yabrak became popular in the Levant as an appetizer
        or a main course. Yabrak leaves stuffed with rice and meat are served hot as a 
        main meal. Yalanji, on the other hand, are leaves stuffed with rice and 
        vegetables, cooked in a tangy sauce with olive oil, and served cold as an appetizer.

Kibbeh 
    Description:
        Kibbeh Kezabah colloquially means ‘lying Kibbeh’! It took on this name
        because it does not contain any meat—the implication being that those 
        who eat it are deceived by its excellent taste. Adopted from Turkish 
        cuisine, Kibbeh Kezabah is one of the most popular appetizers in the 
        Middle East. It can be eaten with lettuce, lemon, or stuffed in a steaming vine leaf.
